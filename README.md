TODO: Insert Image of Setup (maybe also .stl files???)

## Installation

In order for this project to compile VS-Code is used with the following extensions:

* C/C++ Extension
* Platformio

In Platfrmio the following additional libraries need to be included:

- adafruit/Adafruit GFX Library@^1.11.5
- adafruit/Adafruit ILI9341@^1.5.

When opening the repo with VS-Code you should be asked if you want to install the recomended Platformio extension automatically. When installed platformio should automatically search and install the requiered additional libraries.
